# Markdown
You probably use Microsoft Word to write most of your assignments, and you could certainly find a *worse* word processor.

Word's Styles feature allows you to customize any document as you wish, and the Review tab lets you track changes and add comments to your work or someone else's. These features are genuinely useful, but you don't need them for most tasks.

Most of the time, you just need headings, paragraphs, bold/italics, and links. If that's all you need, then you should *absolutely* try Markdown.

## Markdown
Markdown offers an easier way to write. I'll provide some examples in this document, but you can find more information on the [Markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

### Syntax

* *Italics*

## Markdown with GitHub
Markdown works seamlessly with GitHub, which means Markdown files will look great on your GitHub page. If you want to keep track of multiple drafts without ever worrying about your computer crashing or your files getting lost, Markdown is the way to go.

Oh, and you can copy and paste right into Medium, Google Docs, or even Word (though why even bother?).

### Create a Markdown repository
1. Make a folder somewhere on your machine (e.g., the Documents folder) called **Markdown**.
2. In Atom, create a Markdown file called, lastname.md. Try adding some Markdown syntax to this file. Save the file to your Markdown folder.
3. In GitHub Desktop, click the **Create Repository** button.

## Atom packages
Computer people love Markdown, so you can find plenty of free Markdown apps. But you can also just use Atom, which should come with Markdown capabilities preinstalled. Just save your file with the **.md** extension.

If you're a notetaker (and if you're not, you should be), you might also try the **Markdown Folder** package.
1. Go to Atom => Preferences => Install
2. Search for and install the Markdown Folder package.
3. Quit and restart Atom to enable Markdown folding.  
**Note:** This package can be buggy. If it doesn't work and you really want it to work, see me.
