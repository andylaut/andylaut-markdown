# Markdown
You probably use Microsoft Word to write most of your assignments, and you could certainly find a *worse* word processor. Word can do all kinds of cool stuff if you care to [learn how to use it](https://lynda.vt.edu)!

Most of the time, though, you just need headings, paragraphs, bold/italics, and links. If that's all you need, then you should *absolutely* try Markdown. It's faster, neater, and (once you get used to it) more convenient.

## Markdown
Markdown offers an easier way to write. See examples immediately below, but also visit the [Markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for more options.

## Markdown with GitHub
Markdown works seamlessly with GitHub, which means Markdown files will look great on your GitHub page. If you want to keep track of multiple drafts without ever worrying about your computer crashing or your files getting lost, Markdown is the way to go.

Oh, and you can copy and paste right into Medium, Google Docs, or even Word (though why even bother?).

### Create a repository for your Markdown files
You can keep Markdown files in any repository you want--or just keep them on your hard drive--but we'll make a repository for extra-safe keeping.

1. In GitHub Desktop, click the **Create Repository** button. (Looks like a plus sign.) Name the repository **githubusername-markdown** (or whatever) and adjust the local path (i.e., the folder on your computer where you want to keep your files) if necessary.
2. In Atom, create a Markdown file called lastname-markdown.md. (Again, you can choose a different name, but use the **.md** extension and remember the name.) Try adding some Markdown syntax to this file.
3. Save the .md file to the folder you created in step 1.
4. Back in GitHub Desktop, commit the changes, sync, and verify that changes appear on your GitHub page (github.com). Now, any change you make to the Markdown folder on your computer (files added, files edited), you can push to GitHub.

## Atom packages
Computer people love Markdown, so you can find plenty of free [Markdown apps](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring#standalone-applications). But you can also just use Atom, which should come with Markdown capabilities preinstalled. Just save your file with the **.md** extension. If you want to preview a Markdown file, press cmd/ctrl-p and type **Markdown preview**.

# Fountain
Fountain is like Markdown but for movie scripts. You can see the syntax on the [official Fountain page](https://fountain.io/syntax).

To install the Fountain package in Atom:
1. Go to Atom => Preferences => Install.
2. Search for Fountain.
3. Install the Fountain package.
4. Quit and restart Atom.

Once you've installed the Fountain package, try creating a Fountain script.
1. Create a new file, **githubusername-fountain.fountain**. Save this file in your Markdown folder.
2. Add some Fountain syntax to your file (use the link above). Preview the file by typing cmd/ctrl-p then typing fountain preview.
3. Commit to your GitHub Markdown folder. The Fountain file might not look great, but it should appear in your GitHub repository.
